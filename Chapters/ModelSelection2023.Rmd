# Model Selection and Estimation {#ChapModelSelection}

*Chapter Preview*. Model selection and estimation are fundamental
aspects of statistical modeling. Chapters \@ref(ChapFrequency-Modeling)
and \@ref(ChapSeverity) have described how to fit parametric models to
frequency and severity data, respectively. This chapter begins with
nonparametric estimation. To compare alternative parametric models, it
is helpful to summarize data without reference to a specific parametric
distribution. Section \@ref(S:MS:NonParInf) describes nonparametric
estimation, and how it can be used to provide starting values for
parametric procedures.To provide a flavor as to how they can be adapted
to alternative sampling schemes, Section \@ref(S:MS:ModifiedData)
describes estimation for modified data including grouped, censored and
truncated data (following the Section \@ref(S:MaxLikeEstimation)
introduction). The process of model selection is then summarized in
Section \@ref(S:MS:ModelSelection), including tools for model
comparisons and diagnostics. Although our focus is on data from
continuous distributions, the same process can be used for discrete
versions or data that come from a hybrid combination of discrete and
continuous distributions.

## Model Selection {#S:MS:ModelSelection}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, you learn how to:

-   Determine measures that summarize deviations of a parametric from a nonparametric fit 
-   Describe the iterative model selection specification process 
-   Outline steps needed to select a parametric model 
-   Describe pitfalls of model selection based purely on in-sample data when compared to the advantages of out-of-sample model validation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to nonparametric tools for model selection based on marginal
distributions of outcomes ignoring explanatory variables, this section
underscores the idea that model selection is an iterative process in
which models are cyclically (re)formulated and tested for
appropriateness before using them for inference. After an overview, we
describe the `r Gloss('model selection')` process from Section
\@ref(S:Process) based on:

-   an `r Gloss("in-sample")` or training dataset,
-   an `r Gloss("out-of-sample")` or test dataset, and
-   a method that combines these approaches known as
    `r Gloss("cross-validation")`.

## Tools for Model Selection and Diagnostics {#S:MS:ToolsModelSelection}

Section \@ref(S:MS:NonParInf) introduced nonparametric estimators in
which there was no parametric form assumed about the underlying
distributions. However, in many actuarial applications, analysts seek to
employ a parametric fit of a distribution for ease of explanation and
the ability to readily extend it to more complex situations such as
including explanatory variables in a regression setting. When fitting a
parametric distribution, one analyst might try to use a gamma
distribution to represent a set of loss data. However, another analyst
may prefer to use a Pareto distribution. How does one determine which
model to select?

Nonparametric tools can be used to corroborate the selection of
parametric models. Essentially, the approach is to compute selected
summary measures under a fitted parametric model and to compare it to
the corresponding quantity under the nonparametric model. As the
nonparametric model does not assume a specific distribution and is
merely a function of the data, it is used as a benchmark to assess how
well the parametric distribution/model represents the data. Also, as the
sample size increases, the empirical distribution converges almost
surely to the underlying population distribution (by the strong law of
large numbers). Thus the empirical distribution is a good proxy for the
population. The comparison of parametric to nonparametric estimators may
alert the analyst to deficiencies in the parametric model and sometimes
point ways to improving the parametric specification. Procedures geared
towards assessing the validity of a model are known as
`r Gloss('model diagnostics')`.

### Graphical Comparison of Distributions {#S:MS:GraphComparison}

We have already seen the technique of overlaying graphs for comparison
purposes. To reinforce the application of this technique, Figure
\@ref(fig:ComparisonCDFPDF) compares the empirical distribution to two
parametric fitted distributions. The left panel shows the distribution
functions of claims distributions. The dots forming an "S-shaped" curve
represent the empirical distribution function at each observation. The
thick blue curve gives corresponding values for the fitted gamma
distribution and the light purple is for the fitted Pareto distribution.
Because the Pareto is much closer to the empirical distribution function
than the gamma, this provides evidence that the Pareto is the better
model for this dataset. The right panel gives similar information for
the density function and provides a consistent message. Based (only) on
these figures, the Pareto distribution is the clear choice for the
analyst.

(ref:ComparisonCDFPDF) **Nonparametric Versus Fitted Parametric Distribution and Density Functions. The left-hand panel compares distribution functions, with the dots corresponding to the empiricaldistribution, the thick blue curve corresponding to the fitted gamma and the light purple curve corresponding to the fitted Pareto. The right hand panel compares these three distributions summarized using probability density functions. **

```{r ComparisonCDFPDF, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:ComparisonCDFPDF)', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.60, fig.align='center'}
library(MASS)
library(VGAM)
# Inference assuming a gamma distribution
fit.gamma2 <- glm(Claim~1, data=ClaimData,family=Gamma(link=log))
#summary(fit.gamma2, dispersion = gamma.dispersion(fit.gamma2))

theta<-exp(coef(fit.gamma2))*gamma.dispersion(fit.gamma2) #mu=theta/alpha
alpha<-1/gamma.dispersion(fit.gamma2)

#  Inference assuming a Pareto Distribution
fit.pareto <- vglm(Claim ~ 1, paretoII, loc=0, data = ClaimData)
#summary(fit.pareto)
#head(fitted(fit.pareto))
#exp(coef(fit.pareto))

x <- seq(0,15,by=0.01)

par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
LogPercentiles  <- ecdf(log(ClaimData$Claim))
plot(LogPercentiles,  main="", xlab="Log Claims", ylab="Distribution Function", cex=1)
Fgamma_ex = pgamma(exp(x), shape = alpha, scale=theta)
lines(x,Fgamma_ex,col="blue")
Fpareto_ex = pparetoII(exp(x),loc=0,shape = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[2]), scale = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[1]))
lines(x,Fpareto_ex,col="purple")
legend("bottomright", c("log(claims)", "Gamma","Pareto"), lty=1, cex=0.6,col = c("black","blue","purple"))

plot(density(log(ClaimData$Claim)) ,main="", xlab="Log Claims")
fgamma_ex = dgamma(exp(x), shape = alpha, scale=theta)*exp(x)
lines(x,fgamma_ex,col="blue")
fpareto_ex = dparetoII(exp(x),loc=0,shape = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[2]), scale = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[1]))*exp(x)
lines(x,fpareto_ex,col="purple")
legend("topright", c("log(claims)", "Gamma","Pareto"), lty=1, cex=0.6,col = c("black","blue","purple"))
```

For another way to compare the appropriateness of two fitted models,
consider the `r Gloss("probability-probability (pp) plot")`. A $pp$ plot
compares cumulative probabilities under two models. For our purposes,
these two models are the nonparametric empirical distribution function
and the parametric fitted model. Figure \@ref(fig:PPPlot) shows $pp$
plots for the Property Fund data introduced in Section \@ref(S:LGPIF).
The fitted gamma is on the left and the fitted Pareto is on the right,
compared to the same empirical distribution function of the data. The
straight line represents equality between the two distributions being
compared, so points close to the line are desirable. As seen in earlier
demonstrations, the Pareto is much closer to the empirical distribution
than the gamma, providing additional evidence that the Pareto is the
better model.

(ref:PPPlot) **Probability-Probability ($pp$) Plots. The horizontal axis gives the empirical distribution function at each observation. In the left-hand panel, the corresponding distribution function for the gamma is shown in the vertical axis. The right-hand panel shows the fitted Pareto distribution. Lines of $y=x$ are superimposed.**

```{r PPPlot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:PPPlot)', out.width='80%', fig.asp=0.60, fig.align='center'}
#  PP Plot
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
Fgamma_ex = pgamma(ClaimData$Claim, shape = alpha, scale=theta)
#plot(Percentiles(ClaimData$Claim),Fgamma_ex, xlab="Empirical DF", ylab="Gamma DF",cex=0.4)
Fn <- ecdf(ClaimData$Claim)
plot(Fn(ClaimData$Claim), Fgamma_ex, xlab="Empirical DF", ylab="Gamma DF", cex=0.4)
abline(0,1)

Fpareto_ex = pparetoII(ClaimData$Claim,loc=0,shape = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[2]), scale = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[1]))
#plot(Percentiles(ClaimData$Claim),Fpareto_ex, xlab="Empirical DF", ylab="Pareto DF",cex=0.4)
plot(Fn(ClaimData$Claim), Fpareto_ex, xlab="Empirical DF", ylab="Pareto DF", cex=0.4)
abline(0,1)
```

A $pp$ plot is useful in part because no artificial scaling is required,
such as with the overlaying of densities in Figure
\@ref(fig:ComparisonCDFPDF), in which we switched to the log scale to
better visualize the data. The Chapter 5 *Technical Supplement A.1*
introduces a variation of the $pp$ plot known as a
`r Gloss('Lorenz curve')`; this is an important tool for assessing
income inequality. Furthermore, $pp$ plots are available in multivariate
settings where more than one outcome variable is available. However, a
limitation of the $pp$ plot is that, because it plots *cumulative*
distribution functions, it can sometimes be difficult to detect *where*
a fitted parametric distribution is deficient. As an alternative, it is
common to use a `r Gloss("quantile-quantile (qq) plot")`, as
demonstrated in Figure \@ref(fig:QQPlot).

The $qq$ plot compares two fitted models through their quantiles. As
with $pp$ plots, we compare the nonparametric to a parametric fitted
model. Quantiles may be evaluated at each point of the dataset, or on a
grid (e.g., at $0, 0.001, 0.002, \ldots, 0.999, 1.000$), depending on
the application. In Figure \@ref(fig:QQPlot), for each point on the
aforementioned grid, the horizontal axis displays the empirical quantile
and the vertical axis displays the corresponding fitted parametric
quantile (gamma for the upper two panels, Pareto for the lower two).
Quantiles are plotted on the original scale in the left panels and on
the log scale in the right panels to allow us to see where a fitted
distribution is deficient. The straight line represents equality between
the empirical distribution and fitted distribution. From these plots, we
again see that the Pareto is an overall better fit than the gamma.
Furthermore, the lower-right panel suggests that the Pareto distribution
does a good job with large claims, but provides a poorer fit for small
claims.

(ref:QQPlot) **Quantile-Quantile ($qq$) Plots. The horizontal axis gives the empirical quantiles at each observation. The right-hand panels they are graphed on a logarithmic basis. The vertical axis gives the quantiles from the fitted distributions; gamma quantiles are in the upper panels, Pareto quantiles are in the lower panels.**

```{r QQPlot, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:QQPlot)', out.width='80%', fig.asp=0.90, fig.align='center'}

xseq = seq(0.0001, 0.9999, by=1/length(ClaimData$Claim))

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.3.1. Actuarial Exam Question.** The graph below shows a $pp$
plot of a fitted distribution compared to a sample.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap='', out.width='40%', fig.asp=1, fig.align='center'}
# set of points
x <- c(    0, 0.1, 0.2,  0.25, 0.4,  0.5,  0.6,  0.7,  0.8, 0.85, 0.9,  1)
y <- c(-0.05, 0.3, 0.23, 0.25, 0.33, 0.38, 0.41, 0.46, 0.7, 0.85, 0.95, 1)
lo <- loess(y~x)
xl <- seq(min(x),max(x), (max(x) - min(x))/1000)
plot(xl, predict(lo,xl), type="l", xlab="Sample", ylab="Fitted", cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5)

abline(0,1)
```

Comment on the two distributions with respect to left tail, right tail,
and median probabilities.

`r HideExample('5.3.1', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** The tail of the fitted distribution is too thick on the
left, too thin on the right, and the fitted distribution has less
probability around the median than the sample. To see this, recall that
the $pp$ plot graphs the cumulative distribution of two distributions on
its axes (empirical on the x-axis and fitted on the y-axis in this
case). For small values of $x$, the fitted model assigns greater
probability to being below that value than occurred in the sample (i.e.
$F(x) > F_n(x)$). This indicates that the model has a heavier left tail
than the data. For large values of $x$, the model again assigns greater
probability to being below that value and thus less probability to being
above that value (i.e. $S(x) < S_n(x)$). This indicates that the model
has a lighter right tail than the data. In addition, as we go from 0.4
to 0.6 on the horizontal axis (thus looking at the middle 20% of the
data), the $pp$ plot increases from about 0.3 to 0.4. This indicates
that the model puts only about 10% of the probability in this range.

### Statistical Comparison of Distributions {#S:MS:Tools:Stats}

When selecting a model, it is helpful to make the graphical displays
presented. However, for reporting results, it can be effective to
supplement the graphical displays with selected statistics that
summarize model goodness of fit. [Table 5.2](#tab:5.2) provides three
commonly used `r Gloss('goodness of fit statistics')`. In this table,
$F_n$ is the empirical distribution, $F$ is the fitted or hypothesized
distribution, and $F_i^* = F(x_i)$.

<a id=tab:5.2></a>

Table 5.2. **Three Goodness of Fit Statistics**

$$
{\small
\begin{matrix}
\begin{array}{l|cc}
\hline
\text{Statistic} & \text{Definition} & \text{Computational Expression} \\
\hline
\text{Kolmogorov-} & \max_x |F_n(x) - F(x)| & \max(D^+, D^-) \text{ where } \\
~~~\text{Smirnov} && D^+ = \max_{i=1, \ldots, n} \left|\frac{i}{n} - F_i^*\right| \\
&& D^- = \max_{i=1, \ldots, n} \left| F_i^* - \frac{i-1}{n} \right| \\
\text{Cramer-von Mises} & n \int (F_n(x) - F(x))^2 f(x) dx & \frac{1}{12n} + \sum_{i=1}^n \left(F_i^* - (2i-1)/n\right)^2 \\
\text{Anderson-Darling} & n \int \frac{(F_n(x) - F(x))^2}{F(x)(1-F(x))} f(x) dx & -n-\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1) \log\left(F_i^*(1-F_{n+1-i})\right)^2 \\
\hline
\end{array} \\
\end{matrix}
}
$$

The *Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic* is the maximum absolute difference
between the fitted distribution function and the empirical distribution
function. Instead of comparing differences between single points, the
*Cramer-von Mises statistic* integrates the difference between the
empirical and fitted distribution functions over the entire range of
values. The *Anderson-Darling statistic* also integrates this difference
over the range of values, although weighted by the inverse of the
variance. It therefore places greater emphasis on the tails of the
distribution (i.e when $F(x)$ or $1-F(x)=S(x)$ is small).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.3.2. Actuarial Exam Question (modified).** A sample of claim
payments is:

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
29 & 64 & 90 & 135 & 182  \\
\end{array}
$$

Compare the empirical claims distribution to an exponential distribution
with mean $100$ by calculating the value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
statistic.

`r HideExample('5.3.2', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** For an exponential distribution with mean $100$, the
cumulative distribution function is $F(x)=1-e^{-x/100}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\hline
x & F(x) & F_n(x) & F_n(x-) & \max(|F(x)-F_n(x)|,|F(x)-F_n(x-)|) \\
\hline
29  & 0.2517 & 0.2 & 0   & \max(0.0517, 0.2517) = 0.2517 \\
64  & 0.4727 & 0.4 & 0.2 & \max(0.0727, 0.2727) = 0.2727 \\
90  & 0.5934 & 0.6 & 0.4 & \max(0.0066, 0.1934) = 0.1934 \\
135 & 0.7408 & 0.8 & 0.6 & \max(0.0592, 0.1408) = 0.1408 \\
182 & 0.8380 & 1   & 0.8 & \max(0.1620, 0.0380) = 0.1620 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic is therefore

$$
KS = \max(0.2517, 0.2727, 0.1934, 0.1408, 0.1620) = 0.2727 .
$$

## Iterative Model Selection {#S:MS:Iterative:Selection}

In our model development, we examine the data graphically, hypothesize a
model structure, and compare the data to a candidate model in order to
formulate an improved model. @box1980sampling describes this as an
*iterative process* which is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:Iterative).

(ref:Iterative) **Iterative Model Specification Process**

```{r Iterative, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Iterative)', out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/F5Iterative.png")
```

This iterative process provides a useful recipe for structuring the task
of specifying a model to represent a set of data.

1.  The first step, the model formulation stage, is accomplished by
    examining the data graphically and using prior knowledge of
    relationships, such as from economic theory or industry practice.
2.  The second step in the iteration is fitting based on the assumptions
    of the specified model. These assumptions must be consistent with
    the data to make valid use of the model.
3.  The third step is *diagnostic checking*; the data and model must be
    consistent with one another before additional inferences can be
    made. Diagnostic checking is an important part of the model
    formulation; it can reveal mistakes made in previous steps and
    provide ways to correct these mistakes.

The iterative process also emphasizes the skills you need to make data
analytics work. First, you need a willingness to summarize information
numerically and portray this information graphically. Second, it is
important to develop an understanding of model properties. You should
understand how a probabilistic model behaves in order to match a set of
data to it. Third, theoretical properties of the model are also
important for inferring general relationships based on the behavior of
the data.

## Model Selection Based on a Training Dataset {#S:MS:Tools:Stats:Likelihood}

As introduced in Section \@ref(S:Process), it is common to refer to a
dataset used for fitting the model as a *training* or an *in-sample*
dataset. Techniques available for selecting a model depend upon whether
the outcomes $X$ are discrete, continuous, or a hybrid of the two,
although the principles are the same.

**Graphical and other Basic Summary Measures.** Begin by summarizing the
data graphically and with statistics that do not rely on a specific
parametric form, as summarized in Section \@ref(S:MS:NonParInf) above.
Specifically, you will want to graph both the empirical distribution and
density functions. Particularly for loss data that contain many zeros
and that can be skewed, deciding on the appropriate scale (e.g.,
logarithmic) may present some difficulties. For discrete data, tables
are often preferred. Determine sample moments, such as the mean and
variance, as well as selected quantiles, including the minimum, maximum,
and the median. For discrete data, the mode (or most frequently
occurring value) is usually helpful.

These summaries, as well as your familiarity of industry practice, will
suggest one or more candidate parametric models. Generally, start with
the simpler parametric models (for example, one parameter exponential
before a two parameter gamma), gradually introducing more complexity
into the modeling process.

Critique the candidate parametric model numerically and graphically. For
the graphs, utilize the tools introduced in Section
\@ref(S:MS:ToolsModelSelection) such as $pp$ and $qq$ plots. For the
numerical assessments, examine the statistical significance of
parameters and try to eliminate parameters that do not provide
additional information. In addition to statistical significance of
parameters, you may use the following model comparison tools.

**Likelihood Ratio Tests.** For comparing model fits, if one model is a
subset of another, then a likelihood ratio test may be employed; the
general approach to likelihood ratio testing is described in Appendix
Sections \@ref(S:AppA:HT:LRT) and \@ref(S:AppC:MLEModelVal).

**Goodness of Fit Statistics.** Generally, models are not proper subsets
of one another in which case overall goodness of fit statistics are
helpful for comparing models. *Information criteria* are one type of
goodness of statistic. The most widely used examples are Akaike's
Information Criterion (*AIC*) and the (Schwarz) Bayesian Information
Criterion (*BIC*); they are widely cited because they can be readily
generalized to multivariate settings. Appendix Section
\@ref(S:AppA:HT:IC) provides a summary of these statistics.

For selecting the appropriate distribution, statistics that compare a
parametric fit to a nonparametric alternative, summarized in Section
\@ref(S:MS:Tools:Stats), are useful for model comparison. For discrete
data, a *goodness of fit* statistic (as described in Section
\@ref(S:goodness-of-fit)) is generally preferred as it is more intuitive
and simpler to explain.

## Model Selection Based on a Test Dataset

`r Gloss('Model validation')` introduced in Section \@ref(S:Process) is
the process of confirming that the proposed model is appropriate based
on a *test* or an *out-of-sample* dataset, especially in light of the
purposes of the investigation. Model validation is important since the
model selection process based only on training or in-sample data can be
susceptible to `r Gloss("data-snooping")`, that is, fitting a great
number of models to a single set of data. By looking at a large number
of models, we may overfit the data and understate the natural variation
in our representation.

Selecting a model based only on in-sample data also does not support the
goal of `r Gloss('predictive inference')`. Particularly in actuarial
applications, our goal is to make statements about *new* experience
rather than a dataset at hand. For example, we use claims experience
from one year to develop a model that can be used to price insurance
contracts for the following year. As an analogy, we can think about the
training dataset as experience from one year that is used to predict the
behavior of the next year's test dataset.

We can respond to these criticisms by using a technique known as
**out-of-sample validation**. The ideal situation is to have available
two sets of data, one for training, or model development, and the other
for testing, or model validation. We initially develop one or several
models on the first dataset that we call *candidate* models. Then, the
relative performance of the candidate models can be measured on the
second set of data. In this way, the data used to validate the model are
unaffected by the procedures used to formulate the model.

**Random Split of the Data.** Unfortunately, rarely will two sets of
data be available to the investigator. As mentioned in Section
\@ref(S:Process), we can implement the validation process by splitting
the dataset into **training** and **test** subsamples, respectively.
Figure \@ref(fig:ModelValidation) illustrates this splitting of the
data.

(ref:ModelValidation) **Model Validation. A dataset is randomly split into two subsamples.**

arrows(7.4,-0.9,3.5,-3.8,code=2,lwd=2,angle=15,length=0.2)

```

Various researchers recommend different proportions for the allocation.
@snee1977validation suggests that data-splitting not be done unless the
sample size is moderately large. The guidelines of @picard1990data show
that the greater the number of parameters to be estimated, the greater
the proportion of observations is needed for the training subsample for
model development.

**Selecting a Distribution.** Still, our focus so far has been to select
a distribution for a dataset that can be used for actuarial modeling
without additional explanatory or input variables $x_1, \ldots, x_k$.
Even in this more fundamental problem, the model validation approach is
valuable. If we base all inference on only in-sample data, then there is
a tendency to select more complicated models than needed. For example,
we might select a four parameter GB2, generalized beta of the second
kind, distribution when only a two parameter Pareto is needed.
Information criteria such as `r Gloss('AIC')` and `r Gloss('BIC')`
introduced in Appendix Section \@ref(S:AppA:HT:IC) include penalties for
model complexity and thus provide protection against over-fitting, but
using a test sample may also help achieve parsimonious models. From a
quote often attributed to Albert Einstein, we want to "use the simplest
model as possible but no simpler."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.3.3. Wisconsin Property Fund.** For the 2010 property fund
data from Section \@ref(S:LGPIF), we may try to select a severity
distribution based on out-of-sample prediction. In particular, we may
randomly select 1,000 observations as our training data, and use the
remaining 377 claims to validate the two models based respectively on
gamma and Pareto distributions. For illustration purposes, We compare
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics respectively for the training and test
datasets using the models fitted from training data.

Based on in-sample prediction, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit
statistic for the gamma distribution turns out to be
`r round(InSampleGamma$statistic,digits=4)` and for the Pareto
distribution is `r round(InSamplePareto$statistic,digits=4)`. Based on
out-of-sample prediction, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit
statistic for the gamma distribution turns out to be
`r round(OutSampleGamma$statistic,digits=4)` and for the Pareto
distribution is `r round(OutSamplePareto$statistic,digits=4)`. Based on
both in-sample and out-of-sample prediction, the Pareto model seems to
give considerably better goodness of fit under the random seed used in
the code for splitting the training and test data.

**Model Validation Statistics.** In addition to the nonparametric tools
introduced earlier for comparing marginal distributions of the outcome
or output variables ignoring potential explanatory or input variables,
much of the literature supporting the establishment of a model
validation process is based on regression and classification models that
you can think of as an *input-output* problem (@james2013introduction).
That is, we have several inputs or predictor variables
$x_1, \ldots, x_k$ that are related to an output or outcome $y$ through
a function such as $$y = \mathrm{g}\left(x_1, \ldots, x_k\right).$$For
model selection, one uses the training sample to develop an estimate of
$\mathrm{g}$, say, $\hat{\mathrm{g}}$, and then calibrate the average
distance from the observed outcomes to the predictions using a criterion
of the form

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{n}\sum_i \mathrm{d}(y_i,\hat{\mathrm{g}}\left(x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ik}\right) ) .
(\#eq:OutSampleCriter)
\end{equation}
```
Here, "d" is some measure of distance and the sum $i$ is over the test
data. The function $\mathrm{g}$ may not have an analytical form and can
be estimated for each observation using the different different types of
algorithms and models introduced earlier in Section
\@ref(S:ManyVarAnalytics). In many regression applications, it is common
to use the squared Euclidean distance of the form
$\mathrm{d}(y_i,\mathrm{g}) = (y_i-\mathrm{g})^2$ under which the
criterion in equation \@ref(eq:OutSampleCriter) is called the **mean
squared error (MSE)**. Using data simulated from linear models, Example
2.3.1 uses the **root mean squared error (Rmse)** which is the squared
root of the MSE. From equation \@ref(eq:OutSampleCriter), the MSE
criteria works the best for linear models under normal distributions
with constant variance, as minimizing MSE is equivalent to the maximum
likelihood and least squares criterion in training data. In data
analytics and linear regression, one may consider transformations of the
outcome variable in order for the MSE criteria to work more effectively.
In actuarial applications, the **mean absolute error (MAE)** under the
Euclidean distance $\mathrm{d}(y_i,\mathrm{g}) = |y_i-\mathrm{g}|$ may
be preferred because of the skewed nature of loss data. For right-skewed
outcomes, it may require a larger sample size for the validation
statistics to pickup the correct model when large outlying values of $y$
can have a large effect on the measures. Following Example 2.3.1, we use
simulated data in Examples 5.3.4 through 5.3.7 to compare the AIC
information criteria from Appendix Chapter \@ref(S:AppA:HT:IC) with
out-of-sample MSE and MAE criterion for selecting the distribution and
input variables for outcomes that are respectively from normal and
right-skewed distributions including lognormal and gamma distributions.
For right skewed distributions, we find that the AIC information
criteria seems to work consistently for selecting the correct
distributional form and mean structure (input variables), whereas
out-of-sample MSE and MAE may not work for right-skewed outcomes like
those from gamma distributions, even with relatively large sample sizes.
Therefore, model validation statistics commonly used in data analytics
may only work for minimizing specific cost functions, such as the MAE
that represents the average absolute error for out-of-sample prediction,
and do not necessarily guarantee correct selection of the underlying
data generating mechanism.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.3.4. In-sample AIC and out-of-sample MSE for normal
outcomes**. Example 2.3.1 assumes that there is a set of claims that
potentially varies by a single categorical variable with six levels. To
illustrating in-sample over-fitting, it also assumes that two of the six
levels share a common mean that differs from rest of levels. For Example
2.3.1, the claim amounts were generated from a linear model with
constant variance, for which in-sample AIC and out-of-sample Rmse
provide consistent results from the cross-validation procedure to be
introduced in the next section. Here, we may use the same data
generation mechanism to compare the performance of in-sample AIC with
the in-sample and out-of-sample Rmse criteria. In particular, we
generate a total of 200 samples and split them equally into the training
and test datasets. From the output table, we observe the two-level model
was correctly selected by both in-sample AIC and out-of-sample MSE
criteria, whereas in-sample MSE prefers an over-fitted model with six
levels. Thus, due to concerns of model over-fitting, we do not use
in-sample distance measures such as the MSE and MAE criterion that
favors more complicated models.

**Example 5.3.5. MSE and MAE for right-skewed outcomes - lognormal
claims**. For claims modeling, one may wonder how the MSE and MAE types
of criterion may perform for right-skewed data. Using the same data
generating procedure, we may generate lognormal claim amounts by
exponentiating the normal outcomes from the previous example. We fit the
lognormal claim amounts with gamma and lognormal regression commonly
used for ratemaking and claims analytics. For the specific data
generating mechanism, we observe that it requires a larger sample size
for out-of-sample Rmse and MAE to select the correct distributional form
and mean structure, when compared with in-sample AIC criteria. The AIC
criteria is able to pick out the correct model with a sample size of
200, while out-of-sample MSE and MAE fail to. Thus, for right skewed
output, precautions need to be taken when using model validation
statistics that may be sensitive to large claim values, particularly
when the sample size is relatively small.

**Example 5.3.6. MSE and MAE for right-skewed outcomes - gamma claims**.
For right-skewed outcomes, we may be interested in studying how the MSE
and MAE types of measures work for another loss severity distribution,
the gamma distribution, that is widely used in ratemaking and claims
analytics. Here, we use a similar mean structure for generating claims
amounts based on a gamma regression with the log link function. We fit
the data using gamma regression and lognormal regression. For gamma
outcomes, the table shows that out-of-sample MSE and MAE criterion fail
to select the correct distributional form or the mean structure even
with a total of 1000 samples. By changing the gamma shape parameter, you
may see that the out-of-sample MSE and MAE criterion work in certain
settings for correctly selecting the distributional form or the mean
structure, but the performance of such model validation statistics does
not seem to be consistent across different parameter values and sample
sizes for right-skewed gamma outcomes. Again, the AIC criteria seems to
be working consistently in selecting the correct distribution and mean
structure for the data generated from gamma distributions, even with a
smaller sample size of 200.

Chapter \@ref(ChapPremiumFoundations) describes another measure, the
`r Gloss('Gini index', '4.2')`, that may be useful in actuarial
applications particularly when there is a large proportion of zeros in
claims data (corresponding to no claims) that may invalidate the
aforementioned model validation statistics.

## Model Selection Based on Cross-Validation {#S:MS:Cross-Validation}

Although out-of-sample validation is the gold standard in predictive
modeling, it is not always practical to do so. The main reason is that
we have limited sample sizes and the out-of-sample model selection
criterion in equation \@ref(eq:OutSampleCriter) depends on a *random*
split of the data. This means that different analysts, even when working
the same dataset and same approach to modeling, may select different
models. This is likely in actuarial applications because we work with
skewed datasets where there is a large chance of getting some very large
outcomes and large outcomes may have a great influence on the parameter
estimates.

**Cross-Validation Procedure.** Alternatively, one may use
**cross-validation**, as follows.

-   The procedure begins by using a random mechanism to split the data
    into $K$ subsets of roughly equal size known as *folds*, where
    analysts typically use 5 to 10.
-   Next, one uses the first $K$-1 subsamples to estimate model
    parameters. Then, "predict" the outcomes for the $K$th subsample and
    use a measure such as in equation \@ref(eq:OutSampleCriter) to
    summarize the fit.
-   Now, repeat this by holding out each of the $K$ subsamples,
    summarizing with an out-of-sample statistic. Thus, summarize these
    $K$ statistics, typically by averaging, to give a single overall
    statistic for comparison purposes.

Repeat these steps for several candidate models and choose the model
with the lowest overall cross-validation statistic.

In Example 2.3.1, you have seen that the MSE criteria seems to work with
k-fold cross-validation in selecting the correct mean structure for
claims outcome data generated from linear models with constant variance.
From Examples 5.3.5 and 5.3.6, however, the out-of-sample MSE and MAE
criterion does not seem to provide consistent performance for selecting
the distributional form and the mean structure under right-skewed claims
distributions. Thus, we may use the k-folder cross-validation instead of
out-of-sample prediction to see whether the MSE and MAE types of
criterion work for right-skewed distributions based on lognormal and
gamma regression with a log link function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.3.7. Cross-validation in right-skewed outcomes - lognormal
claims** For lognormal claims, we use the data generating mechanism from
Example 5.3.5 to generate a total of 100 samples, and use the k-fold
cross validation procedure in Example 2.3.1 to select the distributional
form and mean structure. Using cross-validation, we note that both AIC
and out-of-sample MSE and MAE seem to be working for selecting the model
with the correct distribution and mean structure, even with a total of
100 samples.

**Example 5.3.8. Cross-validation in right-skewed outcomes - gamma
claims** For gamma claims, we use the data generating mechanism from
Example 5.3.6 to generate a total of 100 samples, and use the k-fold
cross validation procedure to select the distributional form and mean
structure. Using cross-validation, we note that in-sample AIC seems to
be working for selecting the model with the correct distribution and
mean structure, while out-of-sample MSE and MAE seem to fail in
selecting the distributional form or the mean structure correctly even
after we increase the sample size to 1000.

Cross-validation is widely used because it retains the predictive flavor
of the out-of-sample model validation process but, due to the re-use of
the data, is more stable over random samples. In addition, Example
7.3.1. in Chapter \@ref(ChapSimulation) uses the Wisconsin Property Fund to
perform k-fold cross-validation of the gamma and Pareto models based on
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit statistic. Additional information
and examples regarding re-sampling procedures including leave-one-out
cross-validation and bootstrap can also be found in Chapter
\ref@(ChapSimulation).

## Model Selection for Modified Data {#S:MS:Modified-Data}

So far, you have learned covered model selection using unmodified data.
For modified data including grouped, censored and truncated data, you
have learned parametric and nonparametric estimation of distribution
functions in Section \@ref(S:MS:ModifiedData). For model selection, the
tools from Section \@ref(S:MS:ModelSelection) can be extended to cases
of modified data.

For selection of distributions, the nonparametric tools introduced in
Section \@ref(S:MS:ToolsModelSelection) are based on estimated
parametric and nonparametric distribution functions, and thus can be
extended to modified data for which both types of estimators exist.

For graphical comparisons, the $pp$ and $qq$ plots introduced earlier
can be created for modified data by plotting the parametric estimates
from Section \@ref(S:MS:ModifiedData1) against nonparametric estimates
of the probability or distribution functions from Section
\@ref(S:MS:NonParModified). For example, the `qqPlotCensored` and
`qqtrunc` functions in `R` generate $qq$ plots respectively for censored
(left or right) and truncated data, whereas the `probPlot` function
creates both $pp$ and $qq$ plots with a larger selection of
distributions for right-censored and unmodified data. Additional
graphical tools such as cumulative hazard plots are available in the `R`
package `GofCens`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.4.1. Bodily Injury Claims.** For the Boston auto bodily
injury claims data from Example 5.1.6, we include the full dataset with
right-censoring, and use the $qq$-plot to compare the estimated
quantiles from lognormal, normal and exponential distributions with
those from the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method. From the $qq$-plots in
Figure \@ref(fig:qqCensored), the lognormal distribution functions seems
to fit the censored data much better those based on the normal and
exponential distributions.

(ref:qqCensored) **Quantile-Quantile ($qq$) Plots for Bodily Injury Claims. The horizontal axis gives the empirical quantiles at each observation. The vertical axis gives the quantiles from the fitted distributions; lognormal quantiles are in the left panels, normal quantiles are in the right panels.**

```{r qqCensored, fig.cap='(ref:qqCensored)', fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
library(GofCens)
#BIData <- read.csv("C:/Users/a1727618/OneDrive - Northern Illinois University/LDABOOK/LDA_Ed2-main/Data/DerrigResampling.csv", header =T)
UnCensored <- 1*(BIData$AmountPaid < BIData$PolicyLimit)
par(mfrow=c(2, 3))
## qq-plot for lognormal distribution
probPlot(BIData$AmountPaid, cens = UnCensored, distr = "lognormal", plots = "QQ")
## qq-plot for normal distribution
probPlot(BIData$AmountPaid, cens = UnCensored, distr = "normal", plots = "QQ")
## qq-plot for exponential distribution
probPlot(BIData$AmountPaid, cens = UnCensored, distr = "exponential", plots = "QQ")

```

```{r, echo=SHOW_PDF, ref.label = 'qq-plot censored', eval=FALSE}
```

</div>

In addition to graphical tools, you may use tools from Section
\@ref(S:MS:Tools:Stats) for statistical comparisons of models fitted
from modified data based on parametric and nonparametric estimates of
distribution functions. For example, the `R` package `GofCens` provides
functions calculating the three goodness of fit statistics from Section
\@ref(S:MS:Tools:Stats) for both right-censored and unmodified data. The
`R` package `truncgof`, on the other hand, provides functions for
calculating the three goodness of fit statistics for left-truncated
data.

**Example 5.4.2. Bodily Injury Claims.** For the Boston auto bodily
injury claims with right-censoring, we may use the goodness of fit
statistics to evaluate the fitted lognormal, normal and exponential
distributions from Example 5.4.1. For the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von
Mises and Anderson-Darling statistics, the lognormal distribution gives
values that are much lower than those from normal and exponential
distributions. The conclusion from the goodness of fit statistics is
consistent to that revealed by the $qq$ plots.

```{r KsCensored, fig.cap='(ref:KsCensored)', fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
library(GofCens)
#BIData <- read.csv("C:/Users/a1727618/OneDrive - Northern Illinois University/LDABOOK/LDA_Ed2-main/Data/DerrigResampling.csv", header =T)
UnCensored <- 1*(BIData$AmountPaid < BIData$PolicyLimit)
par(mfrow=c(2, 2))
## Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for lognormal distribution
KS.ln <- gofcens(BIData$AmountPaid, cens = UnCensored, distr = "lognormal")

## Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normal distribution
KS.norm <- gofcens(BIData$AmountPaid, cens = UnCensored, distr = "normal")

## Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for exponential distribution
KS.exp <- gofcens(BIData$AmountPaid, cens = UnCensored, distr = "exponential")


OutMat <- rbind(round(KS.ln$Test[1:3], digits = 3), round(KS.norm$Test[1:3], digits = 3),
                round(KS.exp$Test[1:3], digits = 3) )
colnames(OutMat) <- c("Kolmogorov-Smirnov", "Cramer-von Mises", "Anderson-Darling")
row.names(OutMat) <- c("Lognormal", "Normal", "Exponential")


knitr::kable(OutMat, caption = "**Nonparametric goodness of fit statistics for right-censored Bodily Injury Claims**", booktabs = T)

Other than selecting the distributional form, model comparison measures
such as the likelihood ratio test and information criterion including
the AIC from Section \@ref(S:MS:Tools:Stats:Likelihood) can be obtained
for models fitted based on likelihood criteria based on the likelihood
functions introduced earlier for modified data. For modified data, the
`survreg` and `flexsurvreg` functions in `R` fit parametric regression
models on censored and/or truncated outcomes based on maximum likelihood
estimation which allows use of likelihood ratio tests and information
criterion such as AIC for in-sample model comparisons. For censored and
truncated data, the functions also provide output of residuals that
allow calculation of model validation statistics such as the MSE and MAE
for the iterative model selection procedure introduced in Section
\@ref(S:MS:Iterative:Selection).
